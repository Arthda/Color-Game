		<h2>Rules of the RGB Colour Game</h2>
         <p class="quote">
           Based on the RGB value above (three numbers), select the color you think is being represented. When you guess 
           the answer you get 5 points and lose 1 point for each of the missed answers.You can change modes to Easy or Hard. This is one of the best games for the brain of web developers and designers, helping you to learn and understand the RGB color model.

	      <span class="info">What is RGB?</span> <br> <!-- for new line (br) -->

	                RGB (Red, Green, Blue) is a system of representing colors on a computer display. 
                    Each color is represented by three numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255. The first number represents red, the next represents green and the final number
                    represents how much blue there is. The higher the number, the more of that color. So, for example (255, 0, 0) represents a full red color, because the number 
                    representing red is the highest possible value (255) and there is zero green and zero blue. (0, 0, 0) produces black and (255, 255, 255) produces white (see image).
                    These 3 colors can be combined to produce any visible color.  In this guess the color game, three random number are generated which, when combined,
                    produce a color within the visible spectrum. This color system is used online in web deveopment and design.
